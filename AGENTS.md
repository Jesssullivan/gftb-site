# Agent contract — Great Falls Tool Bus public microsite

## Role and authority

This public repository builds the public static site at
`greatfallstoolbus.org`. It owns reviewed public page copy, build-time `.svx`
daily logs, the static build graph, a qualified application layer, and its
source-independent runtime-base definition.

**Source visibility (operator ruling, 2026-09-09).** This repository's source
is public. This explicitly supersedes the earlier instruction to keep
`gftb-site` private. Jess's internal tooling, member data, private mail, and
private list archives remain outside this repository.

It owns no member records, auth, payments, mail administration, private
content, DNS, Cloudflare state, cluster state, or GitOps apply authority. The
browser may submit the public contact form to the separately owned
`forms.latoolb.us` API. This repo neither implements nor administers that API.

The production image identity is exactly
`ghcr.io/great-falls-tool-bus/gftb-site`. Publishing a `sha-<40 hex SHA>` image
does not deploy it. Infra selection, digest pinning, apex cutover, served
readback, and rollback remain outside this repo. The owner installation and
application lifecycle belong to `great-falls-tool-bus-infra`; its separate
attended continuity path is not evidence of automatic GF convergence.

## Public-content boundary

Public daily-log frontmatter is exactly:

- required: `date`, `title`, `summary`, `tags`, `published`
- optional: `updated`, plus the flat featured-image group `image`,
  `image_alt`, `image_caption`, `image_aspect` (src/lib/featured-image-schema.ts;
  the goals frontmatter carries the same group). `image` and `image_alt`
  travel together; `image` must be a site-relative `static/` path with a
  leak-scan-classified extension, and a `published: true` entry's image must
  resolve to a committed asset or the manifest build (and `just check`)
  fails. A draft's image may name its future `static/` path while the bytes
  wait in `src/content/log/_assets-pending/<slug>/`; draft alt/caption copy
  joins the leak-scan denylist.

Every file in `src/content/log/` is public build input. Entries render only
with `published: true`; a `published: false` file is an operator-pending
TODO(jess) draft (restoration addendum B1.2) that the loader excludes from
every rendered surface. Files and pull requests on this public GitHub
repository are readable, including draft PRs and `published: false` entries.
Those draft states do not make source private. A draft is still leak-scanned
and is never a place to park private text.

Never publish Linear IDs, PR numbers, commit SHAs, tracker pointers,
credentials, member information, private locations, or internal operational
notes. The public site must not expose agent indexes, JavaScript source maps,
developer docs, or private list archives. One repository pointer is
sanctioned (B1.2, demo #94): the SourceLink "Edit this page" affordance links
this repo's own page sources (`/edit/`, `/blob/`, the advisory form) through
the generated `src/lib/generated/source-map.json`, drift-gated by
`just source-map-check`, and the home Notes & Goals surface extends the same
exception to per-row `/edit/` links and the `/tree/` collection link
(operator ruling 2026-09-08); the repo's PR/issue/commit surfaces stay banned
(`scripts/lib/leak-scan-rules.json`). `discuss@latoolb.us` is the public discussion
list and archive; `keyholders@latoolb.us` is a private role list whose archive
is not public.

## Entrypoints and stack

- Use `just <recipe>` for every operation. Builds and checks call the
  image-custodied `gf-action-client`; never run Bazel, Vite, or tests locally
  as an execution fallback. Nix supplies source-editing tools, not admission.
- `just build` selects `site-build` and writes the qualified result into a new
  absolute directory (default `.gf-site-build-result` in this checkout).
  Supply another new absolute directory for another export; the client never
  overwrites an existing result. It does not materialize an unqualified local
  `build/` tree. `//:deployment_bundle` packages the leak-scanned TreeArtifact
  at `/srv` with only the reviewed first-party `Caddyfile`, exact source marker,
  and `/tmp` mode alongside it. Unscanned public site bytes are not publishable.
- `just check` selects the same v4 `validate` action as CI. Its cacheable
  `//:ci_validation_suite` registers current-source Gitleaks, generated
  source/log/goal manifest drift checks, hermetic actionlint, ESLint,
  Prettier, Svelte checks, unit tests, and five Chromium acceptance specs
  over the declared static build. The browser target requires GF's
  provisioned Chromium; it never installs a
  browser or attaches to an ambient preview. It does not prove a deployed LOOK.
  The suite also carries `//:served_tinyvectors_test`, which checks the declared
  client chunks against the TinyVectors version in `MODULE.bazel`. An ambient
  package or a separately rebuilt tree cannot establish that package proof.
  The source SHA comes from the exact checkout; the client owns identity
  verification and refuses missing v4 authority.
- `just conformance`, `test-unit`, `typecheck`, `lint`, and the other check
  aliases select that same suite, not independent local jobs.
- `just qr-verify` cross-checks the pinned payload URL against
  `package.json`'s `homepage`, then regenerates the printed apex QR with the
  pinned qrencode invocation and byte-compares the committed SVG, stripping
  only the exact `<!-- Created with qrencode X.Y.Z ... -->` provenance
  comment so an encoder patch bump is not a false failure. Independent decode
  verification is a manual scan, per the recipe's failure guidance.
- CORRECTION (2026-09-03, operator ruling): the former `just qa-packet` /
  `qa-packet-diff` recipes and the PR `qa-look` CI job were excised. They were
  an evidence-packet capture pipeline (screenshot matrix + receipt uploaded as
  a CI artifact), not a LOOK — no routable QA environment ever existed in that
  flow. The name `qa-look` is reserved for the PullRequestEnvironment/v1
  consumer flow: a routable, tailnet-only, reapable, exact-head QA environment
  per pull request plus the operator LOOK ("the pr-N lane IS the QA
  evidence"). See `docs/qa-look.md`. The finite Chromium acceptance target
  belongs to the remote `validate` suite. It serves only its declared build
  inside that test action; it does not create a deployed preview or LOOK.
  The former local launcher and preview recipe remain removed.
- `just leak-scan` selects `site-build`, whose build graph runs the rules in
  `scripts/lib/leak-scan-rules.json`. `scripts/check-build-output.mjs` is a thin runner over
  `scripts/lib/leak-scan.mjs`, the same module `src/lib/leak-scan.test.ts`
  exercises: one implementation, tested once. It fails closed — a missing or
  empty directory, or a file whose extension is in neither `TEXT_EXTENSIONS`
  nor `SKIP_EXTENSIONS`, is a failure, not a pass.
- `scripts/lib/*` is acceptance-test-only and deliberately outside `src/lib`:
  the leak ruleset carries credential-detection regexes and must never be
  reachable from a client bundle. `eslint.config.ts` forbids `src/**` from
  importing it and `src/lib/leak-scan.test.ts` asserts the same from the other
  side.
- Skeleton and Skeleton Svelte are exact-pinned at `5.0.1`, following the
  proven Svelte 5 pattern in `jesssullivan.github.io`. Do not restore the
  Skeleton 4 compatibility shim.
- `.github/lanes.json` is the source-only ActionPlan/v4 schema-3 plan: finite
  Bazel targets, one abstract REAPI capability demand, and one closed result
  disposition per action. It says nothing about repositories, tenants,
  providers, runner labels, pools, endpoints, credentials, publication, or
  lifecycle. `validate` is status-only. `site-build` requests the exact regular
  files in `//:deployment_bundle`'s `default` output group through
  `ActionOutputSet/v1`; the application workflow does not rediscover them.
  The public `/srv` subtree depends on `//:scanned_build`, never directly on
  `//:build`; the other three members are fixed deployment configuration.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` keeps the two action callers at immutable
  ci-templates revision `c732248e` and prepares a main-only, opt-in publisher
  caller at signed Draft revision `b09bd078`. That revision is not a released
  publication path: its exact-source, installed-client and same-invocation
  runtime proofs remain outstanding. The adopting organization installs its own App,
  controller, overlay, and generic `gf-v4-dispatch` edge; this repository does
  not enumerate or select them. There is no v3, local, cache-only, hosted,
  direct-endpoint, or repository-specific runner fallback.
- `tinyland.repo.json` is the schema-v2 consumer instance. It names only this
  forge identity and the consumer-owned `great-falls-tool-bus-infra` overlay;
  the house schema is vendored byte-for-byte from signed `site.scaffold` PR
  #163 head `0abc7f9e93bf4b84c7550684c38fbf822eab7cd0`, SHA-256
  `9f60d0934e23f1f2437faade24630249b77c303b00d92cf372d1a4fc5252d83c`.
  It contains no execution pool, binding state, provider, runner, endpoint,
  placement, or fallback field.

### Which CI job runs which gate

The ordinary action callers use immutable schema-3 source
`xoxd-ai/ci-templates/.github/workflows/spoke-ci-v4.yml@c732248e379e276d9d98b601519c161a03bffe09`.
The existing `Jesssullivan` fork allowlist remains a workflow admission hint,
not publication or installed execution authority. Each job selects one
checked-in action name; the reusable workflow checks out the exact source and
invokes the compiled GF client once. This pin exports qualified action results;
the main-only publisher caller is separately prepared against signed Draft
`b09bd078dddc6e042eeb27a9b9e0f88c2bb5e119`, with a distinct
`packages: write` grant. Its release, matching installed client, exact-head
qualification and adoption remain required; this source is not runtime proof.

| Caller job | Action plan entry | Requested Bazel action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validate` | `validate` | `test //:ci_validation_suite` |
| `site-build` | `site-build` | `build //:deployment_bundle` |
| `site-publisher` (main push only; Draft source) | `site-build` | qualified `build //:deployment_bundle` and GF-I09 publication in one invocation |

`just ci` selects both declared remote actions. There is no local browser,
analysis, coverage, or candidate-publication recipe outside this plan.

## Home presentation layer

Two enhancement layers sit on the home page, both additive over a served HTML
that is complete without them.

- `src/lib/wiper/**` and `src/lib/components/{NotesAndGoals,WiperScene,WiperControls}.svelte`:
  the Notes & Goals windshield wiper. The notes page under a DOM mask driven by
  a runes engine; a GPU scene behind the notes and a blade layer over them run
  on a ladder `webgpu -> webgl2 -> none`, where `none` is the plain grid. Every
  rung is silent by construction (no console output from a renderer, ever); a
  device or context lost after selection remounts the scene on fresh canvases,
  bounded. Reduced motion, scripts off, paper and forced colours all render the
  same plain grid of every row, which is the rollback surface. The stalk
  starts on High on every load; nothing about the wiper is stored. Contract pins live in
  `src/lib/wiper/contract.test.ts`; the browser rows in `e2e/home-goals.spec.ts`
  and `e2e/wiper-parity.spec.ts`.
- `src/lib/intro/**`, `src/lib/components/{HomeIntro,BusMark}.svelte`, the
  sync script in `src/app.html` and the "Home intro" block in `src/app.css`:
  the first-load intro. On every full load of `/` a page-ground veil holds
  while the brand mark drives in from the left and parks at centre (the one
  place the mark may travel; the bus itself stays parked), waits for the
  wiper's canvases to report a rung (3.0 s minimum, 5.5 s cap), lifts to the
  header and hero, then a scripted scroll lands
  Notes & Goals under the header. No storage. Any input, a hidden tab, a URL
  fragment, reduced motion, forced colours, or any scroll that is not its own
  cancels it and leaves the page where it is; focus is never moved. Pins in
  `src/lib/intro/contract.test.ts`; rows in `e2e/home-intro.spec.ts`.

Test and LOOK hooks, read from `<html>` (no URL query, no storage):
`data-wiper-tier-max="webgl2|none"` caps the ladder before mount;
`data-intro-off` (or `window.__gftbIntroOff = true` before the sync script
runs) keeps the intro from arming; `data-subscribe-capture-dwell-ms="<n>"`
credits the list-signup capture modal's dwell (n=0 lets a rig arm it as soon
as the hero is scrolled past) and is read only by that component, which only
exists on a build made with `PUBLIC_SUBSCRIBE_CAPTURE=1` (the committed Bazel
build selects this flag; an off build excludes it); the component publishes its arm
decision on `<html data-subscribe-capture>`. Specs whose scroll-position premises the
intro would break opt out through `e2e/support/intro.ts`.

Execution evidence comes from the registered remote actions and their declared
browser coverage, not a local Vite build or preview server. The interaction
specs are preserved as source; their presence does not claim every spec is in
the finite remote browser suite. Operator-attended LOOKs happen in the
operator's own browser against the exact served PR environment.

## Deployment and package safety

Operator ruling, 2026-09-08: GFTB stays on GitHub Free. The September 9
public-source ruling supersedes that ruling's private-source restriction.
GitHub branch protection, rulesets, and a paid plan are not prerequisites for
this site's integration or publication. The ruling
is carried by Meta ADR 0014 section 7 and ADR 0022 Amendment 7 in
[Meta #63](https://github.com/Great-Falls-Tool-Bus/meta/pull/63).

Signed commits, exact-head independent review, and successful registered
remote checks remain required. GF/org admission must bind the exact
repository, source and workflow identities, qualified action output, and
signed release verification. This contract does not claim those mechanisms
are already installed or that a release has passed them. Keep their runtime
and owner publication requirements intact; no consumer policy switch or
fallback replaces them. See [the CI contract](docs/CI-SCHEMA.md).

The GF-I09 publisher owns qualified application publication after the export
action. This repository has no separate candidate workflow or local Nix
application-image constructor. It owns neither production dispatch nor infra,
DNS, or edge credentials. GitHub Pages workflows are forbidden. A merge,
green CI, or successful package push is not served-site proof.

Public source does not establish image-package visibility or pullability. The
operator release lane may make only the reviewed web image package public
after publication, then must prove anonymous manifest and digest pull. Do not
add registry credentials or image-pull secrets here.

## Delete-after-rewire policy

The repository tip contains only live carriers. When a path becomes obsolete:

1. Map every reference from AGENTS, Just, CI, Bazel, skills, schemas, tests,
   licenses, and deployment contracts.
2. Rewire those live consumers to the chosen replacement.
3. Delete the superseded Markdown, script, generated copy, JSON, fixture, and
   workflow in the same change. Git history is the recovery mechanism.
4. Run `just source-map-check`, `just endpoint-check`, `just secrets-scan-dir`,
   `just conformance`, `just check`, and `just build` before landing.

Do not keep historical evidence directories, research notes, examples, public
agent artifacts, or unused scaffolding “just in case.” Do not delete a schema
or script while any live entrypoint still references it.

## Multi-agent and git posture

- One lead session holds merge authority. Other sessions may open PRs but do
  not merge or close work owned by another session.
- Sync and scan open PRs before starting a lane. File fences win.
- Preserve unrelated dirty worktree changes.
- Use signed commits; never add AI attribution.
- Operator surfacing (operator-derived 2026-09-03; SSD rulings addendum (e)):
  ratifications, agendas, todos, and review items reach the operator in
  exactly one of two forms — decisions via the interview feature
  (AskUserQuestion decision briefs); read/LOOK items opened in the operator's
  Chrome as tabs. Never prose status lists with shell-command fallbacks;
  never GUI `open` (fleet guard). Printing via printstack remains the
  annotation route. The claude-in-chrome prohibition is scoped to agent
  browsing/QA (gstack supersedes there); operator-attended LOOK tab-opening
  is the sanctioned exception. SSOT: `prompts-enqueue`
  `context/house-active-dialog-cadence.md`.

## Licenses and assets

Software is zlib-licensed; written GFTB content is CC BY-SA 4.0. Visual and
vendored-code provenance lives in `NOTICE` and `docs/attribution.md`.

## GFTB SSOT grounding (binding; pointers only — content lives at each SSOT)

Ground every change in these authorities and cite the specific section/ticket
in the PR's Authority table. Reviews check citation-conformance first.
Decisions are decided-by-default: search these before writing "open question".

- meta `Great-Falls-Tool-Bus/meta` @ origin/main (ALWAYS fetch; stale local
  checkouts have produced false not-founds):
  - `spec/launch-member-v0-system-2026-08-16.md` — the contract (public site
    §3, forms §10).
  - `decisions/0014`, `decisions/0015` — ratified ADRs.
  - `spec/gftb-citylink-palette-2026-08-17.md` + `spec/gftb-citylink-palette/`
    — palette: Appendix A = numbers; `gen_board.py` role table = application;
    parity disagreement with `src/lib/theme/palette.ts` = stop condition.
  - `diagrams/launch-member-v0/*.mmd` — the design ontology.
- Demo site = design decisions in code: `greatfallstoolbus.org` repo @ main —
  commits #87, #90, #94; `src/lib/motion.svelte.ts`, `src/lib/nav-items.ts`,
  `src/app.css`, `src/lib/data/cells.ts`, `src/routes/contact/`. Port, never
  reinvent. CORRECTION (2026-09-03): `src/lib/data/cells.ts` and
  `src/routes/contact/` no longer exist on that repo's main (deleted in its
  commit 23d9513); this repo's own `src/routes/contact/` and its tests are now
  the contact-surface truth. The three surviving pointers stand.
- Linear: initiative "Great Falls Tool Bus — Launch" + document "GFTB launch
  operating map" (milestone spine, SLAs, WIP rule live THERE). Read issue
  descriptions AND comment threads.
- `site.scaffold` = machinery only, never GFTB design authority.
- Standing operator rulings (each recorded in meta/Linear; one line here as a
  tripwire): bus permanently parked; vocabulary application/intake (never
  enrollment/ingest/catalog/steward); Maine/TIN-3905 operator-only; forms
  always PoW-gated on their own page; agent-drafted copy ships only as
  `published: false` TODO drafts.
