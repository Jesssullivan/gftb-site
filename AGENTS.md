# Agent contract — Great Falls Tool Bus public microsite

## Fork-first rules, 2026-10-01

These rules come first and supersede any older guidance below that conflicts
with them.

- Agent files for this repository live only on the fork-side
  `agents-overlay` branch. Upstream `main` carries none of them.
- Never `git add` an agent file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/`,
  `.claude/`, `plugins/`, skills, agent docs or agent notes). They are
  untracked and excluded by `materialize.sh`; keep them out of every commit
  and pull request.
- Session notes go to dated comments on the owning Linear issue, not to
  `docs/agent-notes/`. The notes kept here are history only.
- The repository's `.githooks/` (installed by `just setup`) enforce
  fork-first pushes, signed commits and no AI attribution. Where the hooks
  have not landed yet, follow the same rules by hand.
- Pull requests land by squash.

## Live workstreams and reassertion (operator ruling 2026-10-03)

This file carries no status. Read status, goals and product shape from the
SSOTs and point at them instead of restating them:

- Linear projects P-TIN-165 "GFTB Membership & Public Surface", P-TIN-163
  "GFTB Admin Crunch" and P-TIN-164 "GFTB Physical Plant": their issues and
  project updates.
- Linear document "GFTB workstream map 2026-10-03"
  (https://linear.app/tinyland/document/gftb-workstream-map-2026-10-03-aa1362559e3b),
  or its newest dated successor: the live map of streams.
- Product shape and real goals: meta `decisions/` (the latest ratified
  decision wins) and `spec/` (`launch-member-v0-system-2026-08-16.md`,
  `member-provisioning-executable-slices-2026-08-22.md`,
  `gftb-microsite-maturity-2026-08-19.md`), read from a freshly fetched
  upstream `main`; and the latest GFTB product gap analysis document in
  P-TIN-165.
- SLAs, SLOs and goal ladders live in Linear issues and project updates,
  never in this file.

Reassertion cadence: at least once per context window, and again after
compaction or recovery, visibly reassert the active, queued and held
workstreams before mutating anything. For each stream give its ticket,
owner, repo and worktree, branch or PR, state and evidence, dependencies or
blocker, SLA/SLO and next step. Source it from Linear (the map document and
the project issues) and from live git (`git worktree list`, open PRs on the
fork and upstream). Mark reported versus verified facts and unknowns. A
compact table may follow a readable explanation. Record drift as a dated
comment on the owning Linear issue, not here.

Owner split:

- Codex: membership, controller, SMTP and HyperKitty (TIN-4215).
- Claude synthesis seat: public site, UI, release transactions and the
  contributor contract.
- Operator only: legal acts, credential mints, list mutations, the realm
  console and outgoing mail.

## Role and authority

This public repository builds the public static site at
`greatfallstoolbus.org`. It owns reviewed public page copy, build-time `.svx`
daily logs, the static build graph, and a candidate OCI publisher.

**Source visibility (operator ruling, 2026-09-09).** This repository's source
is public. This explicitly supersedes the earlier instruction to keep
`gftb-site` private. Jess's internal tooling, member data, private mail, and
private list archives remain outside this repository.

It owns no member records, auth, payments, mail administration, private
content, DNS, Cloudflare state, cluster state, or GitOps apply authority. The
browser may submit the public contact form to the separately owned
`forms.latoolb.us` API. This repo neither implements nor administers that API.

The production image identity is exactly
`ghcr.io/great-falls-tool-bus/gftb-site`. Publishing a `sha-<40 hex SHA>` image
does not deploy it. Infra selection, digest pinning, apex cutover, served
readback, and rollback remain outside this repo: the attended transaction is
the `web-release-*` recipes of `great-falls-tool-bus-infra`
(`docs/runbooks/oncluster-web-cutover.md` there), run from a clean checkout
of that repo's canonical `main`.

## Public-content boundary

Public daily-log frontmatter is exactly:

- required: `date`, `title`, `summary`, `tags`, `published`
- optional: `updated`, plus the flat featured-image group `image`,
  `image_alt`, `image_caption`, `image_aspect` (src/lib/featured-image-schema.ts;
  the goals frontmatter carries the same group). `image` and `image_alt`
  travel together; `image` must be a site-relative `static/` path with a
  leak-scan-classified extension, and a `published: true` entry's image must
  resolve to a committed asset or the manifest build (and `just check`)
  fails. A draft's image may name its future `static/` path while the bytes
  wait in `src/content/log/_assets-pending/<slug>/`; draft alt/caption copy
  joins the leak-scan denylist.

Every file in `src/content/log/` is public build input. Entries render only
with `published: true`; a `published: false` file is an operator-pending
TODO(jess) draft (restoration addendum B1.2) that the loader excludes from
every rendered surface. Files and pull requests on this public GitHub
repository are readable, including draft PRs and `published: false` entries.
Those draft states do not make source private. A draft is still leak-scanned
and is never a place to park private text.

Never publish Linear IDs, PR numbers, commit SHAs, tracker pointers,
credentials, member information, private locations, or internal operational
notes. The public site must not expose agent indexes, JavaScript source maps,
developer docs, or private list archives. One repository pointer is
sanctioned (B1.2, demo #94): the SourceLink "Edit this page" affordance links
this repo's own page sources (`/edit/`, `/blob/`, the advisory form) through
the generated `src/lib/generated/source-map.json`, drift-gated by
`just source-map-check`, and the home Notes & Goals surface extends the same
exception to per-row `/edit/` links and the `/tree/` collection link
(operator ruling 2026-09-08); the repo's PR/issue/commit surfaces stay banned
(`scripts/lib/leak-scan-rules.json`). `discuss@latoolb.us` is the public discussion
list and archive; `keyholders@latoolb.us` is a private role list whose archive
is not public.

## Entrypoints and stack

- Use `just <recipe>` for every operation. Do not invoke pnpm, Vite, or Bazel
  directly outside the Justfile.
- Enter through `nix develop` / direnv. CI runs Just inside Nix.
- `just build` materializes `//:scanned_build`: the adapter-static `//:build`
  output copied and leak-scanned inside one Bazel action. A scan failure yields
  no declared output, and `//:deployment_bundle` can package only that scanned
  TreeArtifact. A published tree that has never been scanned is not publishable.
- `just check` executes the same cacheable `//:ci_validation_suite` selected by
  the protected v4 `validate` action. It registers the schema/conformance and
  immutable-caller contract, current-source Gitleaks, generated source/log/goal
  manifest drift checks, hermetic actionlint, ESLint, Prettier, Svelte checks,
  unit tests, and five Chromium acceptance specs over the declared static
  build. The browser target requires GF's provisioned Chromium; it never
  installs a browser or attaches to an ambient preview. Local Just output
  is never v4 evidence. A passing browser target is not a deployed LOOK.
  The suite also carries the served-artifact proof for the tinyvectors pin
  (`//:served_tinyvectors_test`): `MODULE.bazel` is the package's only
  resolution, and a build made off-fabric (`vite build` against a stray
  `node_modules/@tummycrypt/tinyvectors`) can bundle another release with
  every other check green; such output is never evidence for blob feel.
- `just conformance` enters the registered `//:bazel_output_contract_test`.
- `just qr-verify` cross-checks the pinned payload URL against
  `package.json`'s `homepage`, then regenerates the printed apex QR with the
  pinned qrencode invocation and byte-compares the committed SVG, stripping
  only the exact `<!-- Created with qrencode X.Y.Z ... -->` provenance
  comment so an encoder patch bump is not a false failure. Independent decode
  verification is a manual scan, per the recipe's failure guidance.
- CORRECTION (2026-09-03, operator ruling): the former `just qa-packet` /
  `qa-packet-diff` recipes and the PR `qa-look` CI job were excised. They were
  an evidence-packet capture pipeline (screenshot matrix + receipt uploaded as
  a CI artifact), not a LOOK — no routable QA environment ever existed in that
  flow. The name `qa-look` is reserved for the PullRequestEnvironment/v1
  consumer flow: a routable, tailnet-only, reapable, exact-head QA environment
  per pull request plus the operator LOOK ("the pr-N lane IS the QA
  evidence"). See `docs/qa-look.md`. The browser acceptance suite
  (`just test-e2e`, `preview-e2e`, `playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/`) is
  unaffected.
- `just leak-scan` runs the rules in `scripts/lib/leak-scan-rules.json` over a
  built artefact. `scripts/check-build-output.mjs` is a thin runner over
  `scripts/lib/leak-scan.mjs`, the same module `src/lib/leak-scan.test.ts`
  exercises: one implementation, tested once. It fails closed — a missing or
  empty directory, or a file whose extension is in neither `TEXT_EXTENSIONS`
  nor `SKIP_EXTENSIONS`, is a failure, not a pass. Set `GFTB_LEAK_SCAN_DENY`
  to add operator-held literals; never commit them.
- `scripts/lib/*` is acceptance-test-only and deliberately outside `src/lib`:
  the leak ruleset carries credential-detection regexes and must never be
  reachable from a client bundle. `eslint.config.ts` forbids `src/**` from
  importing it and `src/lib/leak-scan.test.ts` asserts the same from the other
  side.
- Skeleton and Skeleton Svelte are exact-pinned at `5.0.1`, following the
  proven Svelte 5 pattern in `jesssullivan.github.io`. Do not restore the
  Skeleton 4 compatibility shim.
- `.github/lanes.json` is the source-only ActionPlan/v4 schema-3 plan: finite
  Bazel targets, one abstract REAPI capability demand, and one closed result
  disposition per action. It says nothing about repositories, tenants,
  providers, runner labels, pools, endpoints, credentials, publication, or
  lifecycle. `validate` is status-only. `site-build` requests the exact regular
  files in `//:deployment_bundle`'s `default` output group through
  `ActionOutputSet/v1`; the application workflow does not rediscover them.
  That bundle depends on `//:scanned_build`, never directly on `//:build`.
- No GitHub Actions workflow runs on push or pull request (operator ruling
  2026-09-28); the former `.github/workflows/ci.yml` v4 caller is removed and
  the pre-merge gate is a lab-host `just check` receipt or the ruling's
  equivalent-validator receipt posted on the PR. For this workflow-retirement
  change, existing `just conformance`, `just workflow-validate`,
  `just skills-validate`, and `just secrets-scan-dir` check the changed source
  surfaces on the exact signed head. The full `just check` suite remains unrun
  until GF-provisioned `/bin/chromium` is available. The
  adopting organization installs its own App, controller, overlay, and generic
  `gf-v4-dispatch` edge; this repository does not enumerate or select them.
  There is no v3, local, cache-only, hosted, direct-endpoint, or
  repository-specific runner fallback.
- `tinyland.repo.json` is the schema-v2 consumer instance. It names only this
  forge identity and the consumer-owned `great-falls-tool-bus-infra` overlay;
  the house schema is vendored byte-for-byte from signed `site.scaffold` PR
  #163 head `0abc7f9e93bf4b84c7550684c38fbf822eab7cd0`, SHA-256
  `9f60d0934e23f1f2437faade24630249b77c303b00d92cf372d1a4fc5252d83c`.
  It contains no execution pool, binding state, provider, runner, endpoint,
  placement, or fallback field.

### Which CI job runs which gate

The GitHub caller for these actions was removed under the 2026-09-28 operator
ruling. Until a lab-host or in-cluster caller submits them, the PR carries
the lab-host `just check` receipt or the bounded equivalent-validator source
receipt described above. Neither is a v4 action result. The action plan is
unchanged:

| Former caller job | Action plan entry | Requested Bazel action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validate` | `validate` | `test //:ci_validation_suite` |
| `site-build` | `site-build` | `build //:deployment_bundle` |

`just ci` remains a local developer convenience. It is not CI evidence and is
never an execution fallback for either v4 action.

## Home presentation layer

Two enhancement layers sit on the home page, both additive over a served HTML
that is complete without them.

- `src/lib/wiper/**` and `src/lib/components/{NotesAndGoals,WiperScene,WiperControls}.svelte`:
  the Notes & Goals windshield wiper. The notes page under a DOM mask driven by
  a runes engine; a GPU scene behind the notes and a blade layer over them run
  on a ladder `webgpu -> webgl2 -> none`, where `none` is the plain grid. Every
  rung is silent by construction (no console output from a renderer, ever); a
  device or context lost after selection remounts the scene on fresh canvases,
  bounded. Reduced motion, scripts off, paper and forced colours all render the
  same plain grid of every row, which is the rollback surface. The stalk
  starts on High on every load; nothing about the wiper is stored. Contract pins live in
  `src/lib/wiper/contract.test.ts`; the browser rows in `e2e/home-goals.spec.ts`
  and `e2e/wiper-parity.spec.ts`.
- `src/lib/intro/**`, `src/lib/components/{HomeIntro,BusMark}.svelte`, the
  sync script in `src/app.html` and the "Home intro" block in `src/app.css`:
  the first-load intro. On every full load of `/` a page-ground veil holds
  while the brand mark drives in from the left and parks at centre (the one
  place the mark may travel; the bus itself stays parked), waits for the
  wiper's canvases to report a rung (3.0 s minimum, 5.5 s cap), lifts to the
  header and hero, then a scripted scroll lands
  Notes & Goals under the header. No storage. Any input, a hidden tab, a URL
  fragment, reduced motion, forced colours, or any scroll that is not its own
  cancels it and leaves the page where it is; focus is never moved. Pins in
  `src/lib/intro/contract.test.ts`; rows in `e2e/home-intro.spec.ts`.

Test and LOOK hooks, read from `<html>` (no URL query, no storage):
`data-wiper-tier-max="webgl2|none"` caps the ladder before mount;
`data-intro-off` (or `window.__gftbIntroOff = true` before the sync script
runs) keeps the intro from arming; `data-subscribe-capture-dwell-ms="<n>"`
credits the list-signup capture modal's dwell (n=0 lets a rig arm it as soon
as the hero is scrolled past) and is read only by that component, which only
exists on a build made with `PUBLIC_SUBSCRIBE_CAPTURE=1` (default off,
rehearsal only, no production exposure); the component publishes its arm
decision on `<html data-subscribe-capture>`. Specs whose scroll-position premises the
intro would break opt out through `e2e/support/intro.ts`.

Evidence on a developer host is a local `vite build` into a scratch directory
(`BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR`), `scripts/check-build-output.mjs` on it, `scripts/bazel_output.py
serve-static` on a port, and Playwright through `PLAYWRIGHT_PORT`; the
`chromium-webgpu` project (`PLAYWRIGHT_WEBGPU=1`) covers the top rung on a
software adapter. Operator-attended LOOKs happen in the operator's own browser.

## Deployment and package safety

`.github/workflows/container-ghcr.yml` may publish only the immutable candidate
tag for its exact commit, by attended dispatch only. It has no production dispatch and no infra, DNS, or
edge credentials. GitHub Pages workflows are forbidden. A merge, green CI, or
successful package push is not served-site proof.

Public source does not establish image-package visibility or pullability. The
operator release lane may make only the reviewed web image package public
after publication, then must prove anonymous manifest and digest pull. Do not
add registry credentials or image-pull secrets here.

## Delete-after-rewire policy

The repository tip contains only live carriers. When a path becomes obsolete:

1. Map every reference from AGENTS, Just, CI, Bazel, skills, schemas, tests,
   licenses, and deployment contracts.
2. Rewire those live consumers to the chosen replacement.
3. Delete the superseded Markdown, script, generated copy, JSON, fixture, and
   workflow in the same change. Git history is the recovery mechanism.
4. Run `just source-map-check`, `just endpoint-check`, `just secrets-scan-dir`,
   `just conformance`, `just check`, and `just build` before landing.

Do not keep historical evidence directories, research notes, examples, public
agent artifacts, or unused scaffolding “just in case.” Do not delete a schema
or script while any live entrypoint still references it.

## Multi-agent and git posture

- One lead session holds merge authority. Other sessions may open PRs but do
  not merge or close work owned by another session.
- Sync and scan open PRs before starting a lane. File fences win.
- Preserve unrelated dirty worktree changes.
- Use signed commits; never add AI attribution.
- Operator surfacing (operator-derived 2026-09-03; SSD rulings addendum (e)):
  ratifications, agendas, todos, and review items reach the operator in
  exactly one of two forms — decisions via the interview feature
  (AskUserQuestion decision briefs); read/LOOK items opened in the operator's
  Chrome as tabs. Never prose status lists with shell-command fallbacks;
  never GUI `open` (fleet guard). Printing via printstack remains the
  annotation route. The claude-in-chrome prohibition is scoped to agent
  browsing/QA (gstack supersedes there); operator-attended LOOK tab-opening
  is the sanctioned exception. SSOT: `prompts-enqueue`
  `context/house-active-dialog-cadence.md`.

## Licenses and assets

Software is zlib-licensed; written GFTB content is CC BY-SA 4.0. Visual and
vendored-code provenance lives in `NOTICE` and `docs/attribution.md`.

## GFTB SSOT grounding (binding; pointers only — content lives at each SSOT)

Ground every change in these authorities and cite the specific section/ticket
in the PR's Authority table. Reviews check citation-conformance first.
Decisions are decided-by-default: search these before writing "open question".

- meta `Great-Falls-Tool-Bus/meta` @ origin/main (ALWAYS fetch; stale local
  checkouts have produced false not-founds):
  - `spec/launch-member-v0-system-2026-08-16.md` — the contract (public site
    §3, forms §10).
  - `decisions/0014`, `decisions/0015` — ratified ADRs.
  - `spec/gftb-citylink-palette-2026-08-17.md` + `spec/gftb-citylink-palette/`
    — palette: Appendix A = numbers; `gen_board.py` role table = application;
    parity disagreement with `src/lib/theme/palette.ts` = stop condition.
  - `diagrams/launch-member-v0/*.mmd` — the design ontology.
- Demo site = design decisions in code: `greatfallstoolbus.org` repo @ main —
  commits #87, #90, #94; `src/lib/motion.svelte.ts`, `src/lib/nav-items.ts`,
  `src/app.css`, `src/lib/data/cells.ts`, `src/routes/contact/`. Port, never
  reinvent. CORRECTION (2026-09-03): `src/lib/data/cells.ts` and
  `src/routes/contact/` no longer exist on that repo's main (deleted in its
  commit 23d9513); this repo's own `src/routes/contact/` and its tests are now
  the contact-surface truth. The three surviving pointers stand.
- Linear: the projects and workstream map named in "Live workstreams and
  reassertion" above (streams, SLAs and goal ladders live there). Read issue
  descriptions AND comment threads.
- `site.scaffold` = machinery only, never GFTB design authority.
- Standing operator rulings (each recorded in meta/Linear; one line here as a
  tripwire): bus permanently parked; vocabulary application/intake (never
  enrollment/ingest/catalog/steward); Maine/TIN-3905 operator-only; forms
  always PoW-gated on their own page; agent-drafted copy ships only as
  `published: false` TODO drafts.
