description: Maintain the GFTB v4 Bazel action plan and its remotely executable targets. Use when editing BUILD.bazel, MODULE.bazel, .github/lanes.json, or the thin ci-templates v4 caller; not for provider placement, endpoints, runners, tenant registration, or local cache wrappers.

# GFTB v4 Bazel actions

Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/CI-SCHEMA.md`, `.github/lanes.json`, and the Bazel
targets named by the plan before editing.

## Boundary

- The app repository owns finite Bazel actions and their abstract Core.dhall
  capability requirements.
- The GFTB `-infra` overlay owns GFTB's consumer demand declaration.
- GF core owns types, verification, resolution, and scheduling, but no GFTB
  instance.
- Provider supply and placement are opaque to both consumer repositories.

Never add runner labels, pools, nodes, endpoints, credentials, instance names,
or lifecycle/publication policy to `.github/lanes.json`. Never edit a
producer-owned consumer registry to enroll GFTB.

## CI shape

No GitHub Actions workflow runs on push or pull request (operator ruling
2026-09-28); the former `.github/workflows/ci.yml` caller is removed and the
pre-merge gate is a lab-host `just check` receipt or the ruling's bounded
equivalent-validator source receipt for changed surfaces. The full suite's
Chromium target still requires GF-provisioned `/bin/chromium`. A future caller invokes
`gf-action-client run`; source presence alone is not evidence that the client is installed, an owner overlay
is admitted, or an action executed remotely. Those missing authorities fail
closed. Do not add a v3, hosted, local, cache-only, DinD, wrapper, or
shell-based execution alternative.

Local `just` recipes are developer tools only. Their success is not v4, cache,
or remote-execution evidence.

## Graph changes

Keep action targets finite, workspace-local, and remotely executable. Image
publication, browser sessions, developer servers, cluster apply, and other
side effects do not belong in the action plan. Validate through registered
Just/Bazel entrypoints; do not add a guard script to defend the plan.
